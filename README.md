# Recommendation System with KGAT


This repository contains an implementation of a recommendation system using **Knowledge Graph Attention Network (KGAT)**. KGAT is a state-of-the-art model designed to enhance recommendation accuracy by leveraging the structural information and semantics of knowledge graphs.

## Key Features
- **Knowledge Graph Integration**: Utilizes knowledge graphs to incorporate auxiliary information for improving recommendation quality.
- **Attention Mechanism**: Employs an attention-based approach to capture the importance of entities and relations in the knowledge graph.
- **Jupyter Notebook Implementation**: The project is implemented in Jupyter Notebook, providing clear and interactive code for experimentation and visualization.
- **Customizable**: Easily adaptable to different datasets and configurations.

## Usage
This repository is designed for researchers, students, and practitioners interested in recommendation systems and knowledge graph-based methods. It provides a hands-on implementation and can be extended or modified for various applications.
